# Vitual-pet-project
virtual pet project

Goal create a digital pet.

Requirements.
4 stats
	hunger -if maxed = death
	sleepiness -if maxed = death
	boredom -fi maxes = death
	age just increments as time passes

Buttons for
	feeding
	sleep
	play

Name pet at start

Pet must evolve or morph

Animate pet while it is alive. 
	can flip image by using css easily.
	keyframes to shift image around.
		might be able to use an animated gif set to essentially an idle animation


Possible add ons

Go with a tamagotchi mock up and the buttons on it have words. can use by clocking those options.
Could rock either flex box or grid.

Multiple pet options.
Pet sounds.
More activities for pet.
A shop with toys you can purchase for the pet as presents. - would require a way to get money.
Animated gif for pet

can use super with class to extend the class to have more properties on it.

So base pet. Then late could add in modifiers or whatever.

Dont know how to spell(typos)
figuring out how to turn off setInterval when pet dies so it doesn't keep ticking up the boredom (timer was declared in a function initially so scope issues made me unable to locate it later to stop)
